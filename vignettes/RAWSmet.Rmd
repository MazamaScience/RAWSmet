The **RAWSmet** R package is being developed for the USFS AirFire gruop to help 
modelers andscientists more easily work weather data from RAWS stations across 
North America.

The package makes it easier to obtain data, perform analyses and generate 
reports. It includes functionality to:
  
* access metadata and archival timeseries data from https://cefa.dri.edu/raws
* access metadata and latest month timeseries data from https://raws.dri.edu
* save and reload .RData versions of these in a rawsDataDir
* determine which locations obtained from metadata are too close to be 
considered “unique” locations
* convert between UTC and local timezones
* apply various algorithms to the data 5rolling means, aggregation, _etc._
* provide interactive timeseries and maps through RStudio’s Viewer pane
* create a variety of publication ready maps and timeseries plots
